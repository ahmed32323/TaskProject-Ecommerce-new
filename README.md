Perfect! Since your project is a **Laravel-based E-commerce web application**, Iâ€™ll tailor the README specifically for **Laravel + AWS setup** including SSM and CloudWatch integration. Here's a polished version:

---

# TaskProject-Ecommerce (Laravel)

## Overview

This project is a **Laravel-based full-stack E-commerce web application** deployed on **AWS EC2**. It allows users to browse products, manage a cart, place orders, and provides an admin panel for product and order management.

* **Frontend:** Blade Templates / HTML / CSS / JS
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Cloud/DevOps:**

  * AWS EC2
  * AWS SSM Agent
  * AWS CloudWatch
  * IAM Roles for access control

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd TaskProject-Ecommerce
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
composer install
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and set up database and AWS details:

```env
APP_NAME=TaskProjectEcommerce
APP_ENV=production
APP_KEY=base64:...
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=http://<EC2-public-IP>

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=<DB_HOST>
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=<DB_NAME>
DB_USERNAME=<DB_USER>
DB_PASSWORD=<DB_PASSWORD>

AWS_REGION=eu-north-1
```

### 4. Generate application key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### 5. Run migrations and seeders

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

### 6. Start the application

```bash
php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

### 7. Access the application

Open in browser:

```
http://<EC2-instance-public-ip>:8000
```

---

## AWS Integration

### SSM Agent

* Ensure EC2 instance has the **AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore** IAM role.
* Start and verify the agent:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart snap.amazon-ssm-agent.amazon-ssm-agent.service
sudo systemctl status snap.amazon-ssm-agent.amazon-ssm-agent.service
```

### CloudWatch Agent

* Configured to monitor system and application metrics: CPU, memory, disk, network, processes.
* Application logs are monitored at:

```
/opt/aws/amazon-cloudwatch-agent/logs/amazon-cloudwatch-agent.log
```

---

## Usage

1. Register or log in as a user
2. Browse products, add items to cart, and place orders
3. Admin users can manage products and view orders

---

## Troubleshooting

* **SSM Access Denied:** Ensure IAM role has `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` policy attached.
* **CloudWatch metrics/logs missing:** Verify CloudWatch agent is running and configured.
* **Laravel errors:** Check logs in `storage/logs/laravel.log` and CloudWatch.

I can also **add a diagram showing EC2, SSM, CloudWatch, and your Laravel app workflow** to make this README more professional and visually descriptive.

Do you want me to add that diagram?
